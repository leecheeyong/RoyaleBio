# [RoyaleBio](https://cr.dino.icu)

A place where Clash Royale players can spice up their profile and track progresses and stats.

## About

This project was inspired by a Discord Bot I made long time ago called [Jet Brawley](https://brawley.js.org), which is also a Clash Royale statistics bot.

## Features

- Track a player's statistics, decks & battle logs
- Track a clan's statistics & members list
- Cards explorer to explore all Clash Royale cards and their rarities

## Credits

- [Royale API](https://royaleapi.com/) for their proxy endpoints, so that the API works on any IP address
- [StatsRoayle CDN](https://statsroyale.com/) for their cards icon
